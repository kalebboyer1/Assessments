// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const AnalysisofRequirements = "This is the second step, which is the process of determining user expectations for a new or modified product."
const Design = "This is the third step, which is to decide upon the look and functioning of the project. Developers typically will secure standards of design quality through the various layers of said design."
const Implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which pertains to the interactions of elements in programming languages. Developers typically recognize and use an element of code or a resource this is written into the program."
const TestingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity."
const Maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which is to modify and update software application after delivery to correct faults and to improve performance."
